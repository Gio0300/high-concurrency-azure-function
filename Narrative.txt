Step	Description
1	Source system publishes messages
2	Azure Service Bus with sessions enabled automatically groups messages into sessions based on the sales order id
3	Azure Functions runtime scales out by launching more instances to cope with the number of sessions. 

Step	Description
1	Source system publishes messages
2	Azure Service Bus with sessions enabled automatically groups messages into sessions based on the sales order id
3a + 3b	Azure Functions runtime scales out by launching more instances to cope with the number of sessions.
4a + 4b	Each function acquires N number of additional sessions locks while it is waiting for the target system to respond.
5	Each function instance still spends the majority of the time idle but now we are maximizing concurrency and thus increasing throughput and reducing overall cost.
